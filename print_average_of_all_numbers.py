# Create a list to store the number inputs
# Loop indefinitely to ask the user for a number
# Prompt the user for input
# Try to convert the input to an integer
# If successful, add the number to the list and update the sum
# Otherwise, break the loop if input is invalid
# Check if there were valid inputs
# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list
# Print the average

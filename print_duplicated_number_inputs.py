# Create an empty dictionary to store number inputs
# Use a for loop to repeat the process 10 times
#   - Prompt the user for a number
#   - If the number exists in the dictionary, increment its count
#   - Otherwise, add the number to the dictionary with a count of 1
# Create an empty list to store duplicate numbers
# Iterate through the dictionary
#   - If a number appears more than once, add it to the list
# Print the list of numbers that were entered multiple times

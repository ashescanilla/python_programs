# Create an empty dictionary to store the number and its input count
# Using a while True loop
# Try asking the user for a number and convert it into an integer
# If the user enters a valid integer value
# Check if the number exists in the dictionary
# If the number exists increase its input count by 1, 
# otherwise add the number to the dictionary with an input count of 1
# If the user enters an invalid integer value,
# break out of the while loop
# Create a variable to store the number with the highest input count, and set its current value to "None"
# Iterate through the dictionary and identify the number with the highest input count
# Check if there were any valid inputs by checking if the variable is not "None"
# Print the variable

# Create a variable to store the number of even number inputs and set its value to 0
# Create a for loop to ask the user for 10 number inputs
# Inside the loop, check if the number is even by using the modulus operator (%)
# If the number is even, increment the counter variable by 1
# After the loop, print the counter variable
